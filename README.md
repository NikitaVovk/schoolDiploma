## Description:
The purpose of this engineering work was to develop a website for managing high school. The website has been implemented with the use of many libraries and tools that support the process of creating an application based on the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. Programming took place in the Intellij Idea programming environment, using the object-oriented Java language. One of the most important libraries used in this project is the Spring library. To store and save data, a MySQL relational database has been created that contains information about all system users and the relationships that occur between them. The database was created using the Hibernate library, which allows it to be modified by Java code. All assumed tasks have been done and tested on the local server.
